# MissingShadowlandsCompanions, a World of Warcraft addon

/mslc prints the list of mission table companions not yet collected (by
soulbind, renown, or a Torghast run) when the mission table is opened.
Output is to the chat window.

/lslc lists followers on all alts that need XP, color-coded by the XP
to next ding. This should make it easy to see which alts to mail BoA
follower XP items to.
